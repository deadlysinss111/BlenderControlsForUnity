This package is a prototype. It is not really comfortable to use yet and not optimized at all.

It is meant to facilitate user experience when it comes to moving / rotating / scaling objects in the editor.


--------------------
How to use:

In the editor, go to the Window tab => SceneWithBlenderControls

In that newly opened scene that won't show any gizmo, you are allowed to use the following commands:

actions:

g => move
r => rotate (need to press an axis to rotate along)
s => scale


axis:

Must be pressed after selecting an action to lock it to a single axis
If pressed with shift, it will select the two other axis (doesn't work with the rotation)

x => lock to x axis
y => lock to y axis
z => lock to z axis
